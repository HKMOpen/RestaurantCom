On the product front, 2014 saw Jacob’s Creek embrace Italian varieties before further flexing its innovative muscles to draw on the spirits expertise of its parent company with the launch of Double Barrel, a Barossa Shiraz and Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon finished in whisky casks. In the wake of Pernod Ricard’s high profile acquisition of Kenwood Vineyards in Sonoma, the group took a further step to strengthen its US presence by bringing Napa winemaker Ehren Jordan over the Australia in order to create a Jacob’s Creek expression specially designed for the US market. The resulting “Two Lands” range hit US shelves in March 2015. It’s not just new product development keeping the brand busy: Jacob’s Creek signed none other than international tennis star Novak Djokovic to front the latest instalment of its “Made By” film series. This is being backed up by a multi-million pound UK marketing campaign for 2015, also being rolled out across Canada, China and Australia, which features the people and places behind the Jacob’s Creek brand in a big to highlight its Australian heritage and provenance. </string>
